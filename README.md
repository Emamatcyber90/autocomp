autocomp
========

Autocomplete JS script. Completely without dependencies! :-)
(You can use [an implementation of the Munkres Algorithm](https://github.com/addaleax/munkres-js)
to achieve better matching results, however.)

Usage and documentation can be found in ac.js.
Using the ac.css is optional, of course.
